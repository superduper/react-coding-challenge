## QA

#### How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?

General criteria for me is to use technologies that are foolproof and powerful while have a rich ecosystem that validates my code and allows me to move quickly. 

Selected components:

- `styled-components`, best way to keep styles for components
- `react-typescript-starter-pack` - template for an app
- TypeScript, scalable and type safe version of JavaScript
- `axios`, flexible TypeScript HTTP client

####  Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?

- Add `react-redux-router` to support browser navigation
- Better use of namespaces

####  What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?

- Add implement stateless components with `react-redux`
- Use styled theme provider to keep shared CSS constant values in one place
- Move components to namespaced folders
